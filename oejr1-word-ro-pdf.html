                            <p> Hello, Hello. Here's an original rundown of the events leading to Double A's eventual black sheep status on the Stern Show. If you've enjoyed this, check out my previous behind the scene write ups on the bottom. Thanks. It’s May 10, 2010 and Mariann from Brooklyn is on the line. She wants to talk about how she waited outside of Letterman with Double A during a Beth Stern appearance. “I was surprised to hear that Double A was out there. We don’t hear from him much,” Robin said before being. The members of Ghost held a meeting on October 4, 2011. At the meeting, Sissi Hagald and Magnus Strömblad were also present. Magnus Strömblad worked as a financial consultant especially in relation to music groups. Magnus Strömblad told us during his testimony, among other things, that it was Sissi Hagald who had asked him to attend the meeting, that he, at the meeting, had said that he used to form an economic association for his bands, that TF had asked him after the meeting to creat. Hi everyone, I came across a Medium post titled 46 Reasons to Not Vote for Bernie Sanders. This digs up a lot of weird, rare stuff. It's mostly all easily debunkable but I want to save everyone time by compiling all the resources into one place, so here's the original piece (https://medium.com/@trevortrevskichurch/46-reasons-to-not-vote-for-bernie-sanders-as-the-46th-president-5000eb4f1df3) I'm replying to. A number of these claims came up in 2015 and you can believe that they'll come up again.

A number of these claims came up in 2015 and you can believe I have been playing at Cloudbet since September 2018 and never had issues, but this time I had and nobody replies besides the casino marketing guy through WhatsApp and every time he says something else. But there is some shady thing that I want to mention. Here is what happened. I play Live Roulette game from January 11th until 14th. 95% I lose since September 20. Anyone knows the game, will agree, that it's really hard to win. Anyway, after I played long hours I had 38 BTC and I requested. Hi folks! Back in early October, I compiled a glossary of DampD acronyms for my website. The lingo is a little bit intimidating when you first jump into DampD discussions, especially ones centered around character building or choosing modules. Since there was some recent discussion expressing frustration with this, I'm copy-pasting the charts here for new users. # General Game Terms Acronym Meaning :--: :-- FLGS Friendly Local Gaming Store DM Dungeon Master GM Game Maste. 
I've been working on a small autonomous vehicle project and getting reliable heading feedback from my MPU9250 IMU using RTIMULib has been an issue that's haunted me for weeks. For background, it's a four-wheeled terrestrial robot built on a standard 1:10 RC car chassis. It's controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3B running ROS Kinetic, and I'm using RTIMULib2 to get data from the IMU. The operating environment is a typical parking lot with a very bumpy surface. The IMU is mounted alone on a plastic # WARNING: The following is a massive wall of text. What began as a few brief paragraphs quickly snowballed into something much bigger. It won't be for everyone, but hopefully some people find it helpful! What follows is the results of my research into names - both of places and people - and how we can apply that to creating rich DampD worlds. Hi all! Recently, I have been putting an awful lot of time and energy into conceiving and consequently labelling a homebrew world.

There is some plausibility to the hypothesis of synergy between polio picornavirus and environmental toxins. (This is NOT an argument against the value of polio vaccines, it is focusing on the potential of synergy to explain a number of features of polio epidemics.) The main areas of interaction ; 1 - Toxins reduce immunity i.e. NK Killer cell activity 2 - Toxins stimulate viral replication in the periphery, and in CNS. 3 - Toxins may facilitate virus entry to nervous system by another means. EDIT: It looks like 'new' Reddit uses a different Markdown engine than 'old' Reddit, so you'll see a lot of carats instead of superscripts if you're using reddit.com. I'll figure out a fix later, but for now this thread works much better using the old.reddit.com page (https://old.reddit.com/r/shorthand/comments/ag2pq0/notes_on_the_reporting_style_of_orthic_shorthand/). At the request of a couple users here, I've put together some notes on W. Stevens's The Teaching of Orthic Shorthand. Since /u/clicheteenager decided to post on the same topic resulting with 2 posts with different activity levels I decided to combine the two with what we know and what we get. Thus a megathread.

So a bit of an update. I'll paraphrase / quote statements made and copy relevant sections from the cases cited in oral arguments. I'll reddit quote excerpts from the cases. Lugosi gets the years of cases frequently wrong so you'll see some discrepancies. I'm going to be seeking written submissions from the parties and the intervenors because I'm a hopeless nerd. Might not get them, but I should be able to at least foia the AG's argument. Whatcott wasn't there on Monday. It was super civil. “Kislev is land, and land is Kislev."

Hi people of r/conlangscirclejerk, So, there are many projects for reforming English spelling and making English spelling phonetic. However, these all suffer from the same problems: Phonetic spelling loses mutual intelligibility with the English writing we know, would require reprinting of an enormous literature, etymological roots become obscured, homophones become undistinguishable and vowels would become based on one dialect only and confuse everyone else. Also, most still retain some ambigu. tl;dr will be below if you don't want to read 5 pages (approx 1170 words) worth of lore or if you don't want to be spoiled on any story This project in total took me around 2 weeks to get the initial timeline down and to edit it nice and polished (although there might be some rough edges with the last min changes I made). Just note that it is in a .PDF (cause Reddit's word limit might be reached) so it'll be on Google Drive to view from, or to download from. Here are many book PDFs, not all specifically radical feminist but all relevant. Please do share these elsewhere, and post more links here if you have any. Knowledge is power, sisters!
